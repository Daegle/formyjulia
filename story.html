        <span class="font-bold">Month 0-1</span><br>
        Our journey began that one day we met eachother online, I went to your profile to check you out and was immediatly stunned by your beauty,
        I wanted to get to know you better so I decided to send you a DM. You were at a party but we could chat regardless.
        Happily you told me that you bought your friend a Hello Kitty plushie for their birthday, which I found adorable.
        You also told me she would buy YOU a big Hello Kitty plushie for your birthday, which made me realize you love Hello Kitty, thats so cute :3.<br><br>
        We got to know eachother better and better, and I was falling for you more and more. We were already matching PFP's and sending lots of cute hearts and emotes, it was really fast, but it felt right.
        What didn't feel completely right was sending all that without being official yet, so I decided to ask you. 17/05/2025, 19:49.
        4 minutes after that we had our first argument, it was about who loved the other person more, deep down we all know that I love you more my love.
        I will never forget this beautiful day ðŸ©µ. <br><br>
        Your birthday was coming up and I was thinking about a present.
        It was quite hard because we didn't know eachother that well yet, but I wanted to give you something special.
        My first thought was sending something about Hello Kitty to your home, sadly I didn't have your adress yet. I tried to contact your bestfriend
        via instagram, she said she lost your adress so I had to come up with something else. Thinking about it, maybe she didn't want to tell me
        your address yet, because we didn't know eachother for that long yet. That is completely reasonable and I fully understand that. Anyhow, 
        I decided to look for something online, I found out that you can see Steam wishlists of other people, so I checked yours. And who would have guessed,
        "Hello Kitty Island Adventure". OFCOURSE! When I saw that I knew I had to get that for you, it was the perfect gift. We were actually
        also exactly 1 week together that day! our first week, it felt special so I decided to give you another game you also had on your wishlist.
        Saw something about a cat overlay that was 99 cents. I HAD to include that as well. 3 Gifts for my sweet girl :3. <br><br>
        We chatted A LOT. Our first moth was really getting to know eachother lots while still being a bit cautious ourselfs, its because we both 
        have quite some trust issues, so we did love eachother but we were still a bit careful. I think this is okay and pretty normal? at least I hope so.
        We told eachother about our pasts, things we have going and also some other stuff thats good to know. Never have I ever texted with someone so much,
        we send thousands of messages every day, its insane. We also started sending tons of tiktoks and reels to eachother, they always make me feel so loved, We also made our own videos about eachother.
        You sent me photos and vids of yourself every now and then, I loved that so much, it made me feel so special. I looked at them alot, I still look at your pics every day, they make me incredibly happy.
        I can't believe how lucky I am to have you in my life, you are the most beautiful person I have ever met, inside and out. <br><br>
        The matching got more and more and slowly we told people like family and friends about us, they were all very happy for us. Oh and also, when I showed
        my family your pics they were all impressed by how pretty you are, they also all liked you alot because I told them who you are and just how much we have in common.
        They are happy for us and can't wait to meet you one day. I cannot wait either, I want to do so much fun things together. I was way to fast, 
        because I already asked if we could meet this year. I didn't know enough about you yet and the fact that there was a lot going on inside of you, that at that time, I did not know yet.
        I felt bad later for asking that, I just really want to be with you in real life, I want to hug you, kiss you and just be with you. <br><br>   
        After an insane amount of chats and time together online we made it to our first month together, we were so happy and proud of ourselves. Because
        of your parents you could only give me online gifts that were free. You felt bad but you didn't know how much all your paragraphs mean to me, I adore them so much. There was, and still is, no reason to feel bad ðŸ©µ. <br><br>
        <span class="font-bold">Month 1-2</span><br>
        At this point we were matching on every platform, we were flirting so much while also making little jokes because we were so comfortable with eachother.
        We sent quite some paragraphs because we both were struggling with overthinking, we were both scared of losing eachother. Now inside we both know the other wouldn't just leave. 
        Still the thought of losing eachother was scary, we both had our own pasts and trust issues. I was so happy with you, 
        but I was also scared that you would leave me, not because I didn't trust you, but because you meant the world to me. I cared, and care, SO MUCH about you.
        I'm glad we could reassure eachother every single time it was needed. We truly are made for eachother, we are so similar and we understand eachother so well. <br><br>
        Just overall more chats and texting and we got to the point where you were getting more comfortable with me, you slowly started 
        telling me more about yourself on a deeper level. I was so happy that you felt comfortable enough to share more with me, it also made me feel a bit bad for you.
        Its because you actually have it quite rough, with your parents and problems. The problems you have also made you overthink more. You thought 
        that I would leave you, just because your exes left you for the problems you have. Your exes were terrible for you, used you and made you feel bad about yourself. 
        I just don't see anything bad about you, I see a beautiful person inside and out, you are so kind and caring, you are the most amazing person I have ever met.
        All the little problems you have will never be a reason for me to leave you, I will always be there for you and support you. No matter what. <br><br>
        The rest of this month was just thousands of texts, tiktoks, reels and photos. We couldn't do alot of games/calls because you share a room
        with your brother, which is annoying. You also hate calling and thats fine by me, I love texting with you and I hoped that sooner or later you would slowly
        become more fine with calling. Playing games was not really an option because of mostly school, you needed to study so much. While you studied
        I would wait for you and after you were done we would chat some more. Its good that you studied a lot and didn't always focus too much on me, I wanted you to do well in school. <br><br>
        And then some good news came, YOU PASSED THE YEAR! I was so happy and proud of you and wanted to give you something. Sadly because you are so sweet you
        declined my gift, you said you only wanted stuff on special occasions. I fully understand and want to thank you for that, you didn't want me tot think you are using me because you couldn't give gifts back that also costs money. I never had that thought but still.
        Thank you. You're the sweetest person ever, you're so kind-hearted and caring ðŸ©µ. <br><br>
        Everytime I was overthinking I just read your paragraphs again, they always make me feel so loved and special. I knew you were the loml but the overthinking couldn't be stopped.
        I was so happy with you, but I was also scared that you would leave me, I didn't want to lose you. I was so scared of losing you that I started overthinking everything. Luckily over time it became less and less. Same goes for you.
        We both had our own pasts and lots of trust issues. Slowly but surely you told me more about your past. I came to realize you've had it quite rough, And I am very proud of everything you have accomplished.
        You are such a strong person, I admire you so much. You should be proud of yourself of what you've got yourself through. I'm so happy we are here for eachother and that
        we can always help eachother, for reassurance, sweet messages and support. <br><br>
        
        <span class="font-bold">Month 2-3</span><br>
        Our 2nd month began very happily. We waited until the clock struck 00:00, so we could celebrate our 2 months together. 
        Ofcourse you had prepared an absolutely beautiful paragraph for me, I was so happy with it like always. We said a lot of sweet things
        to eachother and I was so happy that we made it this far. We were so in love with eachother, it was amazing. Also our overthinking slowly faded, I rarely have it anymore.
        If I overthink its small things and reading your paragraphs always help me. I hope your overthinking is also getting better. <br><br>
        You told me you were actually
        working on something every now and then, something you give me when we finally meet, something about a letter for every month, covered 
        in kisses? OMG you don't know how I felt when I heard that, My heart straight up melted and I got a bit emotional. I was so happy 
        that you were working on something so special for me, I can't wait to see it. I already know it will be so sweet and awesome. We were 
        dreaming about our future together, I always love thinking about that. I can't wait to live together, get pets and start a family. The crazy 
        part is that we already have names for our entire family. We have a name for our future daughter and pets, It's so beautiful. One day this will all be true, I know it. <br><br>
        Sadly this month was not as special as the other ones, you were on vacation and I had no clue it would take that long. Luckily we
        chatted so much like always and we still had so much fun times, you also told me even more things about yourself which I always love and really appreciate to hear. We missed eachother alot
        during this month because we were both out. Your data became a problem as well because you don't really have good internet out there, you decided to save
        your data for our 3rd month anniversary, which is a very special one. I kept missing you throughout all the days but we could always chat in the evenings. I'm happy with that.
        During the day I could take my time to create this website for you and do other stuff while spending the night with you. Except that one night, you know which one. I still feel bad, I'm sorry.


        <br><br>
        Its important to me to know everything about my girlfriend so that I can always help her best and know how to make her feel better. I won't share everything on here
        incase you want other people to read this too, I made it possible for a reason. Just know that everything you told me is safe with me and I will never share it with anyone else unless you ask me to.
        You are my safe space and I hope I am yours, you can always tell me everything and I will always listen to you. Just know that I will never 
        force you to do/tell me stuff. You are allowed to keep some deep things to yourself, I completely understand and respect that. We can be freaky, I love that
        so much its funny and makes me happy, just know that nothing our life will happen without any consent. I will always ask you if you are okay with something and I will never do anything you don't want to do. That is the most important thing to me. Even things like hugs or kisses. Well, maybe not if we're alone. Then I want to kiss and hug you a lot :3.
        I don't ever want something to happen that you don't want, I will always respect your boundaries and feelings. I will give you all the time in the world with everything, I will never rush you into anything.
        I'm a respectful person and I will always try my best and stay that way. Luckily I was raised right and I will try my everything to treat you as best as I can. <br><br>
        That was not entirely part of our life story but its something I just want you to know. <br><br>
        I probably forgot some things but I can update this whenever I want to, so I will do that when I remember something. Its just that we have done so much
        together and we had our silly moments, I can't remember everything right now but I will try my best to include everything. <br><br>
